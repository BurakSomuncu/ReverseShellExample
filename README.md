# ReverseShellExample
A Reverse Shell kit that is solely for educational purposes (like courses or lessons), I do NOT condemn any exploiative usage.
Because of this, this project does NOT use any exploits to bypass any Antivirus Programs. It only contains a way to Set Execution Policy of the Powershell for newer machines (I.E: Windows 11).

This project uses a fork of the NCat called [NCat Portable](https://github.com/cyberisltd/NcatPortable) - Check the Original Nmap license: https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/COPYING
